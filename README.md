A project for presenting videos on interactive info screens.

A video can be looping indefinitely, ex. a menu video waiting for a user to tap on a button.
A video can also play once and thereafter start playing the next video in a sequence.

The project is made with Processing4. See documentation and download the IDE here: https://processing.org/

The videos are from various sample video sites.
